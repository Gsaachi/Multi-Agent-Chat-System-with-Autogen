# Multi-Agent-Chat-System-with-Autogen
This project demonstrates how to build a multi-agent chat system using Autogen, Autogen-AgentChat , and the Groq API (LLaMA3). It allows you to create AI agents (Assistants, User Proxies, Group Chat Managers) that can interact with each other or simulate conversations with a user.
